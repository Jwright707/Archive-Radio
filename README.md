# Work in progress

My goal with this project is to make a simple web app that allows users to play selected classical music recordings from the open collections of [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/).

I'll be using Nextjs in combination with Typescript.

Feel free to follow along or clone the repository and make your own version.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
